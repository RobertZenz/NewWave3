New Wave 3
==========

New Wave 3 is a port of the New Wave GTK+ theme to GTK+ 3.10 (Ubuntu 14.04).

It is currently very incomplete. But the overall goal is to look exactly the
same as New Wave 0.8.2.

How to use
----------

Copy (or link) the `gtk-3.0` directory into your `$HOME/config/` directory.


How to develop
--------------

The `gtk-3.0` directory contains the images and the CSS files, so you just need
to edit those. After that you can use something like the widget factory to test
your changes.
